Forests serve as crucial carbon sinks in combating climate change, necessitating the monitoring of forest cover change for environmental health assessment, biodiversity conservation, and climate change impact understanding. In India, the Forest Survey of India releases forest-related statistics biannually, with forest cover maps and associated geospatial data available for purchase. However, these maps are updated only every two years, limiting insights into local processes. Additionally, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) provides meteorological data for administrative regions rather than ecological regions, hindering the tracking of climate change impacts. To address these challenges, we propose developing a web-GIS portal providing long-term forest cover dynamics data, near-real-time monitoring of major forest areas, and future climate change projections. 
The objectives of our study include:
•	To generate long-term annual forest cover data of India. 
•	To create recent land-use statistics over the National Parks of India.
•	To monitor major forest areas situated within the National Parks in near-real-time using satellite-based data. 
•	Projecting the vulnerability of major forest areas to climate change under future emission scenarios.

We have developed three products to fulfill the given objectives.

We have employed Google Earth Engine to develop web-GIS portals for our products. 
Additionally, all analyses have been conducted using Google Earth Engine, and the scripts for these analyses are provided in this repository.
